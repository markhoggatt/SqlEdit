# SqlEdit

This is an attempt to create an interactive editor for composing SQL queries and execute them against a PostgreSQL database server.

Proposed features include:

- Syntax tree for internal storage
- Colour syntax highlighting
- Preferences panel to configure colours
- Syntax checking

These may extend over time.
